## What user stories were completed this iteration?

We have completed several user stories. We now allow users to choose between two options in a menu. A user can now search a city by name or search a location by zipcode. In addition, a user can continue to look up weather forecasts without having to rerun our script. We have now included an option to "quit." By quitting, it will terminate the app.

We also correctly display the 7 day and hourly forecast with dates and times. For the 7 day forecast, we created come ASCII art to represent the different types of weather conditions like rain, snow, and sunshine.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

For the next iteration, we are going to be focusing on correcting/improving on our tests as well as fixing anything included in our feedback. It is hard to create tests based on API results, therefore, we are hoping to get feedback and improve based on that. We have created the main functions of our weather app. Therefore, we are hoping to polish it up for the last iteration. Lastly, we are going to be looking into what other data we can display to the user. 


## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Everything is working correctly! We were able to correctly implement our new user stories without breaking anything from our previous iteration. 

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line

The user simply needs to run the run.sh script (which is found in the "parent folder" of our project).
