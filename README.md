## What user stories were completed this iteration?

We now allow users to select the units the weather is reported in (metric or imperial). In addition to the units, we give users the option to select a specific hour to view in the hourly report. This also applies to the 7 day forecast. They are allowed to pick a specficic day or justs a regular 7 day report.  We also suggest an outfit based on the current weather. Lastly, the other stories were just code clean up, validating, and testing.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Everything is working correctly! We were able to correctly implement our new user stories without breaking anything from our previous iteration. 

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line

The user simply needs to run the run.sh script (which is found in the "parent folder" of our project).
