## What user stories were completed this iteration?

We have completed 3 user stories. Two of them being the API calls made to OpenWeather API. The third story allows the user to input a city name directly in the console/command line. The two API stories take the user input as a parameter and uses it to get the current weather at that city from the api and display it to the user.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
For the next iteration, we are going to be looking into importing an external java library that we used into our project. As of now, we can't run the bash script because it needs to complie the external java library along with out java program. We aren't sure how to do this, therefore, we will be exploring that. 

We will also be printing our api results to the command line. Right now, we are only displaying the results in the ecllipse console.

Lastly, we will be displaying more weather data in our api call. As of now, we are only displaying the current temperature of a given city. 


## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Our bash script isn't working. We needed to add an external JSON library to our project. We need to tell the bash script to compile/include this library when it executes our java program. We haven't been able to figure it out. We are planning on going to office hours to get that sorted. We have included a sort demo below to show our progress. 

The last thing is, when getting the user input, we do not handle spaces correctly. You can't pass spaces directly as a parameter to a url. Therefore, we have to find a way to convert the space to the correct format for urls.

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line
